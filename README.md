# Minecraft Overviewer Docker Images

Docker Images to Run [Minecraft Overviewer][3]. Overviewer is a render that produces a [Leaflet][4] render of a [Minecraft][5] world.

# How it works

There are two different images to use :
* minecraft-map-builder
* minecraft-map-viewer

The `minecraft-map-builder` has [Minecraft Overviewer][3] installed on it, and read your minecraft server folder to generate all the file to create your online map.
The `minecraft-map-viewer` is a simple python web server that serves the content generated by the map buider. That way, you can scale your http server without having to handle multiple builders.

To use it, check the `docker-compose-example.yml` file in the repo, and create folders like this :

```
<ROOT_FOLDER>
 |
 |- docker-compose-example.yml
 |
 |- server-data/
 |   \_ folder that contains all the files generated by your minecraft server (map, config and players data)
 |
 \- render-data/
     \_ folder that contains the file of the map generated by minecraft-map-builder
```

Simply run `docker-compose -f docker-compose-example.yml up -d` the minecraft server will start, and the builder will generate the map when it will be created by the server (you need to log on the minecraft server at least once since the map is generated when you play).
From the a cron job s running in the `minecraft-map-builder`, updating the map every hour, and the POIs every 5 minutes.
Since there is two different container for overviewer, your map will always be available, event when the builder is generating the map.
